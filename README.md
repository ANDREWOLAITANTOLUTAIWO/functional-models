Since urban poor households are not connected to public-provided water distribution networks (WDN), there is no water meter and so no automatic means of gathering empirical data about the volume of water they use. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate volume of water needed for planning water supply to the households. Hence, this study aims to provide decision-makers with a tool to evaluate volume of water needed by urban poor households for planning water supply to places where there is no WDN.
